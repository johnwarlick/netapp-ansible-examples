This demo shows how Ansible AWX/Tower can empower storage admins to focus on higher-value work by automating new storage requests and cutting time to complete other infrastructure tasks to minutes instead of hours. It is made for the [Getting Started With ONTAP Automation Using Ansible](https://handsonlabs.netapp.com/lab/ontapansible) lab but can be easily adapted for other labs as needed.
