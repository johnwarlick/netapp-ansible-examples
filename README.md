This demo shows how Ansible AWX/Tower can empower storage admins to focus on higher-value work by automating new ONTAP storage requests and cutting time to complete other infrastructure tasks to minutes instead of hours. It is made for the [Getting Started With ONTAP Automation Using Ansible](https://handsonlabs.netapp.com/lab/ontapansible) lab but can be easily adapted for other labs as needed. 

# TODO
- Put API calls to AWX in the mock provisioning app and make it load in the browser.
- Add input masking / validation to mock provisioning app 
- Create bootstrap script to make the lab setup easier. 
- Ansible is at 2.9.9 in this lab, so it would be good to update that. May register a venv for the project and leave the default ansible / python environment alone.
